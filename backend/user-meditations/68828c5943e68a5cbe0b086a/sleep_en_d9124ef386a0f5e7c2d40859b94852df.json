  "text": "Welcome to this yoga nidra practice for sleep... Yoga nidra is a state of conscious relaxation that guides you to the edge of sleep... Lie down comfortably and close your eyes... Allow yourself to be completely supported by your bed...\r\n\r\nBegin by setting an intention for your sleep... This might be 'I will sleep deeply and peacefully' or 'I will wake refreshed and energized'... Choose words that feel right for you... Hold this intention in your heart... ... Now let go of this intention... trusting that it will work in your subconscious mind while you sleep......\r\n\r\nBring your attention to your body lying in bed... Notice the weight of your body on the mattress... Feel the places where your body touches the bed... Your head on the pillow... Your shoulders... Your back... Your legs... ... Simply observe these sensations without trying to change anything... Just notice... and let go... ... Feel yourself becoming heavier with each breath......\r\n\r\nNow become aware of your natural breathing... Don't try to change your breath... Simply observe it... Notice the pause between inhale and exhale... The pause between exhale and inhale... ... Feel your breath becoming slower and deeper... Each breath taking you closer to sleep... Your body knows exactly how to breathe for rest......\r\n\r\nNow imagine your senses withdrawing... Like a turtle pulling its head into its shell... Your eyes become heavy and relaxed... Your ears become quiet and peaceful... Your sense of taste and smell fade away... Your skin becomes less sensitive... ... You're moving inward... away from the external world... toward the peaceful realm of sleep......\r\n\r\nImagine yourself in a place of perfect peace... This might be a cozy room... a peaceful garden... or floating in warm water... You feel completely safe and protected here... ... In this peaceful place, you can let go of all thoughts... all worries... all concerns... There's nothing you need to do... nowhere you need to go... ... You are exactly where you need to be......\r\n\r\nAs you rest in this peaceful state... Know that you are safe... You are loved... You are exactly where you need to be... ... Your body is healing and restoring itself... Your mind is becoming calm and quiet... Sleep comes naturally and easily... ... Tomorrow will bring new possibilities... But right now, there is only peace... only rest... only the gentle drift toward sleep......\r\n\r\nContinue to rest in this state of yoga nidra... Between waking and sleeping... This is the perfect place to be... ... Allow yourself to drift deeper... If you fall asleep, that's perfect... If you stay in this peaceful awareness, that's perfect too... ... Rest now... Sleep now... And wake when it's time... Completely refreshed and renewed...",
