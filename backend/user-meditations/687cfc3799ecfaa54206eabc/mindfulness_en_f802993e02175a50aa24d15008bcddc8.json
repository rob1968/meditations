  "text": "Welcome to this mindfulness meditation... Find a comfortable position where you can sit with alertness and ease... This practice is about cultivating awareness of the present moment... There's nowhere to go and nothing to achieve... simply be here now...\n\nLet's begin by anchoring ourselves in the breath... Notice your natural breathing rhythm... don't change it... just observe... ... Feel the air entering through your nostrils... the slight pause... and the gentle release... ... Your breath is always happening in the present moment... Use it as your anchor to the here and now... When your mind wanders... simply return to the breath... no judgment... just gentle return......\n\nNow expand your awareness to include your body... Notice how you're sitting... Feel the contact points where your body meets the surface... ... Scan through your body with gentle curiosity... What sensations are present right now?... Maybe warmth... coolness... tension... relaxation... ... Simply notice whatever is here... without trying to change anything... Your body is a gateway to presence......\n\nAs we continue... notice any thoughts that arise... Rather than getting caught up in the story... see if you can observe thoughts like clouds passing through the sky of your mind... ... Some thoughts are light and wispy... others might be heavy storm clouds... All are welcome... all will pass... ... You are not your thoughts... you are the aware space in which thoughts appear and disappear......\n\nRight now... in this very moment... everything is exactly as it is... There's a deep peace in accepting what's here... without resistance... ... Listen to the sounds around you... notice they're arising fresh in each moment... ... Feel the aliveness in your body... the energy of being here... now... ... This moment is the only moment that ever exists... and it's constantly renewing itself......\n\nLet these words settle into your awareness... 'I am present'... ... 'I am here now'... ... 'This moment is enough'... ... 'I am aware and awake'... ... 'Peace is found in presence'...\n\nAs we conclude this practice... take a moment to appreciate that you've given yourself the gift of presence... ... Notice how you feel after spending time in mindful awareness... ... When you're ready... slowly open your eyes if they were closed... ... See if you can carry this quality of presence with you... into your next activity... and throughout your day... The present moment is always available... always waiting for your return......",
