  "text": "Welcome to this breathing meditation for stress relief... When we're stressed, our breathing becomes shallow and rapid... This practice will help you use your breath to activate your body's natural relaxation response... Find a comfortable position and close your eyes...\r\n\r\nBegin by simply noticing your breath... Don't try to change it... Just observe... Notice where you feel your breath most clearly... Perhaps at your nostrils... or in your chest... or your belly... ... Simply watch your breath for a few moments... This is your life force... Always available... Always supporting you......\r\n\r\nNow we'll deepen your breathing... Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly... As you breathe in, feel your belly expand... This is deep, diaphragmatic breathing... ... Breathe in slowly through your nose... feeling your belly rise... Breathe out through your mouth... feeling your belly fall... ... Continue this deep breathing... In through the nose... Out through the mouth... Each breath releasing stress......\r\n\r\nNow let's add counting to regulate your breath... Breathe in for a count of four... one... two... three... four...... Hold for four... one... two... three... four...... Breathe out for six... one... two... three... four... five... six...... The longer exhale helps activate your relaxation response...... Continue this pattern... In for four... Hold for four... Out for six...... Feel your nervous system calming with each breath......\r\n\r\nAs you continue this breathing pattern... Imagine breathing in calm, cool air... This air carries peace and tranquility... ... As you breathe out, imagine releasing hot, tense air... This air carries away your stress and worry... ... In... cool, calming air... Out... hot, stressful air... ... With each cycle, you become more relaxed... more at peace......\r\n\r\nAs you breathe, repeat these affirmations silently... 'I am calm'... Breathe in... 'I am at peace'... Breathe out... ... 'I release all stress'... Breathe in... 'I am in control'... Breathe out... ... 'I am safe'... Breathe in... 'I am relaxed'... Breathe out... ... Continue with any affirmations that feel right for you......\r\n\r\nNow let your breathing return to normal... But notice how different it feels... Deeper... more relaxed... more natural... ... Remember, your breath is always with you... Whenever you feel stressed, you can return to this calm breathing... ... Take a moment to appreciate this tool you always carry with you......\r\n\r\nAs we end this breathing meditation... Know that you have accessed your body's natural stress relief system... Your breath is your constant companion... always ready to help you find calm... ... Take three more deep breaths... Wiggle your fingers and toes... When you're ready, open your eyes... You are calm... You are centered... You are at peace...",
