  "text": "Welcome to this soothing ocean sleep meditation...... Settle into your bed and make yourself completely comfortable...... Close your eyes and imagine you're lying on a beautiful beach at sunset...... The sound of gentle waves will guide you to peaceful sleep..........\r\n\r\nBegin by breathing deeply... Inhale the fresh ocean air... feeling it fill your lungs completely... Exhale slowly... releasing all the tension from your day... ... Listen to the rhythm of the waves... In... and out... In... and out... Let your breathing match this natural rhythm... Each breath taking you deeper into relaxation......\r\n\r\nPicture yourself lying on warm, soft sand... The sun is setting, painting the sky in beautiful colors... You can hear the gentle sound of waves rolling onto the shore... Each wave washes away your worries and stress... ... Feel the warm sand supporting your body... The gentle ocean breeze caressing your skin... You are completely safe and peaceful here... ... With each wave that rolls in, you feel more drowsy... more relaxed... The ocean is singing you to sleep......\r\n\r\nNow let the waves wash over your body... Starting with your feet... Feel them becoming as heavy as wet sand... The waves flow up your legs... making them completely relaxed and heavy... ... The gentle water flows over your hips and lower back... All tension melts away like sand being smoothed by the tide... Your arms float peacefully... heavy and relaxed... ... Feel the waves washing over your chest... your shoulders... your neck... Your face becomes soft and peaceful... completely relaxed......\r\n\r\nWith each wave, you know... You are safe and protected... The ocean holds you gently... You are at perfect peace... ... Your body is ready for deep, restful sleep... The waves carry away all your worries... Tomorrow will bring new possibilities... ... Right now, there is only peace... only rest... only the gentle sound of waves......\r\n\r\nContinue to rest here on this peaceful beach... The waves continue their gentle rhythm... rocking you to sleep... ... Let the sound of the ocean carry you into beautiful dreams... Sleep deeply... Rest completely... And wake refreshed like the dawn over the ocean... Sweet dreams......",
