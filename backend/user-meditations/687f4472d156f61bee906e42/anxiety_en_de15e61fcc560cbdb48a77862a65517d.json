  "text": "Welcome to this anxiety relief meditation... Find a comfortable position where you feel supported and safe... You might want to place one hand on your heart and one on your belly... This helps you feel grounded and connected to yourself... Take a moment to arrive here fully...\n\nLet's begin by grounding ourselves in the present moment... Feel your feet on the floor... or your body in the chair... Notice five things you can feel right now... The temperature of the air... The texture of your clothing... The weight of your body... ... This is real... This is now... You are safe in this moment......\n\nNow let's use a calming breath pattern... Breathe in slowly for four counts... one... two... three... four...... Hold gently for four... one... two... three... four...... And exhale slowly for six... one... two... three... four... five... six...... This longer exhale activates your body's relaxation response...... Again... in for four... hold for four... out for six...... Continue this soothing rhythm... feeling calmer with each cycle......\n\nScan your body for any areas of tension or anxiety... You might notice tightness in your chest... butterflies in your stomach... tension in your shoulders... ... That's okay... This is your body trying to protect you... Thank it for caring about your safety... ... Now imagine breathing into these areas... Send them compassion and warmth... With each exhale, let the anxiety soften just a little... You don't have to force anything... Just allow......\n\nImagine yourself in a place where you feel completely safe and calm... This might be a cozy room... a peaceful beach... a quiet forest... wherever feels right for you... ... Notice all the details of this safe place... The colors... the sounds... the smells... the textures... ... Feel yourself relaxing more deeply in this sanctuary... Here, nothing can harm you... You are protected and at peace... ... If anxious thoughts arise, imagine them as leaves floating by on a gentle stream... You can observe them without being swept away......\n\nLet's offer ourselves some calming affirmations... 'I am safe in this moment'... ... 'This feeling will pass'... ... 'I have survived anxiety before, and I will survive it again'... ... 'I am stronger than my anxiety'... ... 'Peace is my natural state'... ... 'I choose calm'......\n\nAs we end this meditation... Remember that you always have these tools available... Your breath... Your safe place... Your inner strength... ... Begin to gently move your body... Maybe stretch a little... Take a deep breath and slowly open your eyes... ... Notice any shift in how you feel... Even a small change is significant... Be gentle with yourself as you return to your day... You are brave... You are capable... And you are not alone......",
