  "text": "Welcome to this body scan meditation for stress release... This practice helps you systematically release tension held throughout your body... Find a comfortable position... Close your eyes and prepare to journey through your body with awareness and compassion...\n\nStart by taking three deep, releasing breaths... Breathe in through your nose... filling your body with calming energy... Exhale through your mouth... releasing the stress of the day... ... Feel your body beginning to relax... Your breath becoming deeper and more natural... Each exhale carries away tension... Each inhale brings peace......\n\nBegin by bringing your attention to the top of your head... Notice any tension or tightness... Breathe into this area... Send relaxation to your scalp... ... Move your attention to your forehead... Often we hold stress here... Let your forehead become smooth and relaxed... ... Notice your eyes... Let them soften... Your jaw... Let it unlock and relax... Feel your whole face becoming peaceful......\n\nNow focus on your neck... This area often holds the weight of our stress... Breathe into your neck... Let it lengthen and soften... ... Bring your attention to your shoulders... Notice if they're raised toward your ears... Let them drop down... Feel the relief as they release... ... Your arms... Let them become heavy and relaxed... Your hands... Let them rest peacefully... All tension flowing away through your fingertips......\n\nFocus on your chest... Sometimes stress makes our chest feel tight... Breathe into your chest... Let it expand and relax... ... Your heart... Send it love and appreciation... It's been working hard... Let it rest in peace... ... Your belly... This is where we often hold emotional tension... Breathe into your belly... Let it soften and release... ... Your back... Let it be supported... All the burdens you carry... let them go......\n\nBring your attention to your hips... Let them settle and relax... ... Your legs... Let them become heavy and loose... Feel the stress draining down through your legs... ... Your feet... Let them completely relax... Feel all the tension leaving your body through your feet... flowing into the earth... ... Your whole body is now relaxed and at peace......\n\nTake a moment to feel your entire body... Relaxed... peaceful... free from tension... ... Notice how different you feel when stress is released... This is your body's natural state... Remember this feeling... You can return to it whenever you need... ... Breathe in this peace... Breathe out any remaining tension......\n\nAs we complete this body scan... Know that you have the power to release stress at any time... Simply breathe into tension and let it go... ... Slowly begin to move your fingers and toes... When you're ready, open your eyes... Carry this relaxation with you into your day... You are calm... You are at peace... You are in control of your stress response......",
