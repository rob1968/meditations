  "text": "Welcome to this stress relief meditation... Find a comfortable seated position, with your back straight but not rigid... Place your feet flat on the floor, feeling the ground beneath you... Rest your hands gently on your lap... And when you're ready, close your eyes or soften your gaze downward...\n\nLet's begin by taking a few deep, cleansing breaths... Breathe in through your nose, filling your lungs completely... And exhale through your mouth, releasing any tension... ... Again, breathe in deeply... feeling your chest and belly expand... And breathe out... letting go of stress and worry... One more time... breathe in fresh, calming energy... And breathe out all that no longer serves you......\n\nNow bring your attention to your body... Notice any areas where you're holding tension... Perhaps in your shoulders... your jaw... your belly... ... Without trying to change anything, simply notice these sensations... Acknowledge them with kindness... ... Now imagine breathing into these tense areas... With each inhale, send breath and space to the tension... With each exhale, feel the tightness beginning to soften... ... Continue this gentle breathing... in... creating space... out... releasing tension......\n\nLet your attention rest on the present moment... Notice the feeling of your breath moving in and out... The gentle rise and fall of your chest... ... When thoughts about your day arise... and they will... simply notice them without judgment... Like clouds passing through the sky... Let them drift by... ... Return your attention to your breath... This is your anchor... Always available... Always present... ... There's nothing you need to figure out right now... No problems to solve... Just this breath... then the next......\n\nImagine a warm, golden light above your head... This is the light of peace and calm... With each breath, this light flows down through your body... ... It flows through your head... releasing mental tension... Down through your neck and shoulders... melting away stress... Through your chest... calming your heart... Down your arms to your fingertips... ... The golden light continues through your belly... soothing any anxiety... Down through your hips and legs... grounding you... All the way to your toes... ... You are now filled with this peaceful, golden light......\n\nAs we prepare to end this meditation... Know that this sense of calm is always available to you... Just a few breaths away... ... Begin to wiggle your fingers and toes... Roll your shoulders gently... And when you're ready, slowly open your eyes... ... Take a moment to notice how you feel... Carry this peace with you as you continue your day... Remember, you can return to this calm center whenever you need... Thank you for taking this time for yourself......",
