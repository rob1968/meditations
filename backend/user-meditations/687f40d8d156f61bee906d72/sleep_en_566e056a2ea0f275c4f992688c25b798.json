  "text": "Welcome to this bedroom sanctuary meditation... Your bedroom is your sacred space for rest and renewal... Tonight, we'll create a sense of safety and peace in your sleeping environment... Close your eyes and feel the comfort of your bed...\n\nFirst, become aware of your bedroom... Notice the temperature... Is it cool and comfortable for sleep?... Feel the softness of your sheets... The support of your mattress... The comfort of your pillow... ... This is your sanctuary... Your safe haven... A place where you can completely let go... ... Feel gratitude for this space that shelters and protects you......\n\nTake three deep breaths... breathing in the peace of your bedroom... exhaling any stress from the day... ... With each breath, feel yourself sinking deeper into your bed... Your body becoming heavier... more relaxed... ... Feel your connection to this safe space... You are held... You are protected... You are home......\n\nNow imagine a gentle light filling your bedroom... This light clears away any negative energy from the day... Any stress... any worry... any tension... ... Watch this light gently dissolve anything that doesn't serve your peaceful sleep... Your bedroom becomes filled with calm, healing energy... ... This space is now perfectly prepared for your rest......\n\nPlace your hands on your heart... Feel your heartbeat... This faithful heart that has carried you through the day... Thank your heart for its constant work... ... Move your hands to your belly... Thank your body for digesting your food... for breathing... for all its automatic functions... ... Your body is wise... It knows how to rest and repair itself while you sleep......\n\nImagine a protective bubble of light surrounding your bed... This bubble keeps you safe while you sleep... Nothing can harm you here... You are completely protected... ... Any worries or fears from the day cannot enter this sacred space... Only peace... only love... only healing energy can reach you here... ... You are safe to completely let go......\n\nAs you rest in your bedroom sanctuary... Know that you are exactly where you need to be... This bed holds you with love... This room protects you with care... ... Your sleep will be deep and peaceful... Your dreams will be gentle and healing... You will wake refreshed and renewed... ... You are blessed... You are loved... You are safe......\n\nContinue to rest in your bedroom sanctuary... Feel the love and protection that surrounds you... Your body is relaxed... Your mind is peaceful... ... Let this sacred space hold you as you drift into sleep... Sleep peacefully... Rest deeply... And wake with gratitude for this gift of rest... Sweet dreams......",
