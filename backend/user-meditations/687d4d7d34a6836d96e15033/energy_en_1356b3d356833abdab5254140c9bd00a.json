  "text": "Welcome to this energizing meditation... Sit or stand in a position that feels strong and alert... Imagine a string pulling you up from the crown of your head... Feel your spine lengthen... your chest open... You're about to awaken your natural vitality...\n\nLet's begin with some energizing breaths... Take a deep breath in through your nose... filling your entire body with fresh energy... And exhale forcefully through your mouth with a 'HA' sound... releasing any fatigue... ... Again, breathe in vitality and life force... And exhale 'HA'... letting go of sluggishness... One more time... inhale power and energy... Exhale 'HA'... feeling more awake......\n\nNow let's awaken your body's energy... Start by rubbing your palms together vigorously... Feel the heat and energy building... Place your warm palms over your eyes for a moment... ... Now tap gently all over your scalp with your fingertips... Awakening your mind... Massage your temples in small circles... ... Roll your shoulders back... feeling your chest open and expand... Gently twist your spine left and right... Feeling energy flow through your core......\n\nImagine a bright golden sun at the center of your chest... This is your inner source of energy... With each breath, this sun grows brighter and larger... ... Feel its warm rays spreading through your entire body... Up through your chest and shoulders... Down your arms to your fingertips... which tingle with energy... ... The golden light flows up through your throat and head... Your mind becomes clear and alert... Down through your belly and hips... Through your legs... grounding you while energizing you... ... Your whole body glows with vibrant life force......\n\nLet's activate your energy with powerful affirmations... 'I am filled with vibrant energy'... ... 'My body is strong and alive'... ... 'I have all the energy I need for my day'... ... 'I am motivated and ready for action'... ... 'Energy flows freely through me'... ... Feel these words charging every cell of your body......\n\nNow let's seal in this energy... Take three deep breaths, making each one bigger than the last... First breath... feeling energy building... Second breath... energy expanding... Third breath... hold it at the top... feel the energy pulsing through you... And release with a smile... ... Feel your eyes bright and alert... Your mind sharp and focused... Your body energized and ready......\n\nAs we complete this energizing meditation... Feel the vitality coursing through your veins... You are awake... alert... and fully charged... ... Begin to move your body however feels good... Maybe stretch your arms overhead... Roll your neck... Bounce gently on your toes... ... When you're ready, open your eyes wide... Take in the world with fresh energy... You are ready to embrace your day with enthusiasm and power... Go forth and shine your light......",
