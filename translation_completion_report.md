## Priority Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Fix Missing Keys**: Add missing keys to Japanese and Chinese
2. **Clean Hindi & Korean**: Remove English text patterns from these "complete" languages
3. **Standardize Extra Keys**: Decide whether language name keys should be added to English or removed from other languages

### Short-term Actions (Medium Priority)  
1. **Portuguese & Dutch**: Fix remaining English text (21-30 instances each)
2. **French & Spanish**: Address English text (43-48 instances each)
3. **Remove Extra Keys**: Clean up non-standard keys in German and Dutch

### Long-term Actions (Lower Priority)
1. **Arabic, Russian, German, Italian**: Major English text cleanup (38-59 instances each)
2. **Consistency Review**: Ensure all languages use consistent terminology
3. **Quality Assurance**: Test each language in the application after fixes

## Estimated Effort

**Total issues to resolve: 381**

Breakdown by effort:
- Missing keys: 8 instances (Quick fix)
- English text cleanup: 366 instances (Time-consuming)
- Extra key standardization: 14 instances (Medium effort)

## Next Steps

1. **Quick wins**: Fix missing keys in Japanese and Chinese (< 1 hour)
2. **Standardization**: Decide on language name key strategy (< 30 minutes)  
3. **Systematic cleanup**: Address English text language by language, starting with Portuguese and Chinese
4. **Validation**: Test each language after completion
5. **Final verification**: Re-run this analysis after all fixes
